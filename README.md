# Home Assistant Tray Menu
Home Assistant integration into the Windows System Tray.

This enables the user to control Home Assistant entities from within the system tray.
Compared to other similar libraries, this feels like a native Windows menu (similar to the one found in the Sounds tray).

For easy configuration, entities can be added, sorted, and edited using a GUI.
