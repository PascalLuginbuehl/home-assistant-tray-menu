Home Assistant integration into the Windows System Tray.

![Home Assistant System Tray](https://github.com/PascalLuginbuehl/home-assistant-tray-menu/assets/17087783/824b3e90-b28e-4595-a0d6-fc5611753b9c)

This enables the user to control Home Assistant entities from within the system tray.
Compared to other similar libraries, this feels like a native Windows menu (similar to the one found in the Sounds tray).

For easy configuration, entities can be added, sorted, and edited using a GUI.
